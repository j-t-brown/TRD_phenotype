# TRD_phenotype

The repository has three R scripts, one for each experiment: 
1) the boLASSO script for feature selection, 
2) the holdout experiment script for the holdout model experiment, and 
3) the optimism adjustment script for more rigorous model comparison.
The datasets used are not referenced or included.
Data pre-processing may look different for each dataset.
The repository also includes an R notebook file, which I used for comparing
model calibraition, ROC, and PR curves and decile analysis.
The notebook file receives model predictions and dataset outcomes as input.
